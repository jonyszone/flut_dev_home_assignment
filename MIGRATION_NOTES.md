# MIGRATION_NOTES.md

## Migration Overview

This project was originally implemented using the latest stable version of Flutter 3.32.0 . For migration purposes, the Flutter version was temporarily downgraded to 3.0.0 to simulate legacy compatibility, and then re-upgraded to the latest stable version.

## âœ… Step 1: Downgraded to Flutter 3.0.0

### Dart SDK: 2.17.0

- Ran: `fvm use 3.0.0`
- Encountered **SDK version constraint conflict**:

Critical Issue #1: Dart SDK Version Mismatch
Problem:

Flutter 3.0.0 comes with Dart SDK 2.17.0
Project requires Dart SDK ^3.7.0
This creates a fundamental incompatibility

### Resolution:
- Temporarily modified `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.17.0 <3.0.0"
